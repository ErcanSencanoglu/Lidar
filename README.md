# Simple-Shape-Recognition-with-Lidar-06.2019

Client has been coded in C++ but Server has been coded in C#, this 2 application communicate each other.  
Lidar getting distance and angle of near objects then send them to server.  
Server try to recognize shapes of object by some algorithm which i coded.  
I did not use any image processing library. I tried to create some algrothims myself to find shapes of objects.  
I coded only some part on Lidar application to send data to server application.
